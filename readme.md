# Pictures memory issue on Chrome

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce and quantify the ["Chrome stores memory that never will be
released when taking a picture"](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=607482) issue,
and is composed of 2 modules. The first is a simple webpage with a input html-field of type 'file', the second
is a Java/Appium project to automatically interact with the webpage and reproduce the mentioned issue.
